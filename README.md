# Movie-Ratings-Problem_pthread_semaphores
## Problem Statement
Rotten Tomatoes is a recommendation website for quality entertainment. The viewers can look for the ratings associated with every movie or series. A set of processes concurrently search in the movie database for keywords. Given a keyword (like dragon), a search process reads all the movie records, identifies only those movies whose descriptions contain the keyword, and prints these movies (names, directors, and release dates only) sorted in the decreasing order of the popularity ratings. In order that the database server does not become overloaded by many search processes, allow at most five processes at any instant. Use a counting semaphore to implement this restriction. When a sixth (or seventh or...) process attempts to make a search, it has to wait until one or more running search processes finish working with the database and signal the semaphore. Implement a synchronization method to solve the problem.
## About The Solution
The solution uses multi-threading and counting semaphores. Here, the counting limit is set to 5 by default. The program reads a file with a bunch of details about movies. A line in the database file represents a movie. The program will ask for keyword input from the user. It will then search for that keyword in the movie database and show all the matching results. The program uses POSIX threads (pthread) and semaphores for synchronization to handle multiple concurrent searches.
